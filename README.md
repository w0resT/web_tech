Lesson1 (and how to work with it):
----------------------------------
First look what's inside `.html` and `.css` files. Try to understand
which style is for what and how they work. Then go to `.js`
and look at the notes for each function. First examine the `window.onload`
function, then `bindUIActions()`, then `slide()`, then `generateSlides()`.

Topics covered:

- what `window.onload` does
- how to write functions
- what is `document.querySelector` and how to use it
- how to generate `html` and insert it to the page
- what is "event listener" and how to use it
- how to use CSS `transform` property in conjunction with `transition` for animations
- how to create triangles or arrows using CSS

Homework:
---------
Extend the functionality of the slider in the way it is possible
to switch to a particular slide, not just backwards or forwards.

For instance I say "slide 23", your slider should be able to jump
to slide 23 invoking `slide()` function only once (obviously it needs to be rewrited).
